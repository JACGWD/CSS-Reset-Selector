# reset-selector
 
This plugin is a simple Wordpress widget that gives students a choice of four different CSS Resets:
- Eric Meyer: Based on the original reset by Eric Meyer, this version has a few slight customizations. See: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
- Eric Meyer with Position: Relative for Everything: Based on the reset file above, this reset includes position: relative as a default for all elements. This is useful in many situations where absolute positioning across deeply nested hierarchies isn't needed.
- Normalize: The modern CSS normalizer (instead of reset) that has been immensely popular for many years. See: https://www.github.com/necolas/normalize.css
- Andy Bell's more modern reset. See: https://github.com/andy-piccalilli/modern-css-reset


## Rationale
Beginner web designers often have difficulties overriding the styles of more opinionated resets such as Normalize. This widget offers students three different "strengths" of reset. Eric Meyer's is a total removal of all styles. Andy Bell's is an intermediate option; with some style left. Nicolas Gallagher's Normalize is the professional option with opinionated style defaults. Useful for students with a stronger understanding of CSS.
